  <p>Welcome to my website!</p>
  <img src="https://content.codecademy.com/articles/github-pages-via-web-app/happy-ice-cream.gif" />
  <p> I am currently 3 weeks into learning to be a Front End Engineer with Codeacademy. This is the first public website I have ever posted and will
     be a constant work in progress as I apply new skills to old.</p>
 <p>Enjoy the madhouse!</p>
